Hurricanes, one of the most destructive natural phenomena on Earth 🌍, have shown changes in frequency, intensity, and trajectory under global warming. Scientists have long been investigating these variations, seeking to understand the key climate drivers behind them.  

This study focuses on **the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**, combining **hurricane higher-order moment (mass moments) analysis with K-Means clustering** to uncover patterns in hurricane behavior and anticipate future trends.
